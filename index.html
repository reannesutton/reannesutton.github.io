				<p class="paragraphleft"> In Seoul, President Moon Jae-in celebrated the potential meeting as a “historic milestone” on the way to peace. Young liberals in their 20s and 30s – Moon’s core support – called for the president to be awarded the Nobel Peace prize. But the news of Trump’s meeting had intense competition from less political topics. There was the constant reporting on K-pop stars, who command a fanatical following, and an actor had killed himself the same day after he was accused of sexual misconduct. While the White House talked of preconditions, analysts in South Korea were focused on Moon’s own meeting with Kim, scheduled for late April. Moon, a democracy activist under the military government in the 1980s and later a human rights lawyer, has made engagement with North Korea a lifelong goal. His parents fled the North during the 1950-53 Korean war and he was chief of staff under Roh Moo-hyun, who followed a “sunshine policy” that included sending aid to the impoverished North and launching joint investment projects.

                Learning coding empowers you to do many things you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. These things include hand-crafting your own websites, becoming a career coder or even starting a technology business. Most importantly, you’ll be able to understand the technology shaping your world. You’ve undoubtedly heard or read somewhere that everyone needs to learn coding, right? Well, people say that for a reason! Whether you’re looking for a career in the industry, starting a new hobby or just wanting to understand technology, you can benefit from learning coding. It’s incredible to think how much the world has changed since 1991, when the World Wide Web first started. The web has taken over our lives and it’s showing no sign of stopping. Who knows where the web will take us in the future? Perhaps in another 10 years every person will have their own website. If one thing’s certain, it’s that a website is a very valuable thing to have these days. If you own a business, a web presence is a must. If you don’t, you still might want a personal blog or portfolio site to sell your skills to prospective employers. Of course, your ability to create and maintain a website is severely limited unless you learn HTML and CSS code, the code that all websites run on.
