				<p class="title"> An extract from one of my essays </p>
				<p class="paragraphleft"> 
					If marriage is bad for women, why do women keep getting married? As it turns out, being unmarried isn't good for women either. Firstly, being an unmarried woman has practical disadvantages. In the UK, for example, married couples are awarded tax breaks, among other financial benefits ranging from pensions to inheritance. The law therefore is purposefully structured so as to give married couples particular benefits that are not afforded to unmarried couples, this much is fairly obvious. Moreover, "the persistence of the gender pay gap and discrimination against women in the workplace, both of which worsen considerably when women become mothers, mean that women are much more dependent than men are on marriage and the financial support of a spouse."  This indicates that women are incentivised to get married, not only for the legal advantages, but for financial security. In this way, it's like taking out an insurance policy; if I don't succeed in my career, if my reproductive system gets in the way of earning money, if I have children (which is a huge emotional and financial expense), then at least I'll have a husband, a safety net to break my fall. What I find more interesting however is the way that unmarried women are normatively evaluated. What role does the unmarried woman have in society and how do we judge the unmarried mother? Do bachelors suffer the same evaluation? The answers to these questions, I think, support my claim that marriage is an oppressive force against unmarried women. If pornography is a crude description of society's collective sexuality manifest (or perhaps pornography is a depiction of what is prescribed to us), then romantic comedies are a manifestation of our ideals about women. In the 'rom com' the ultimate aim of the woman is to find Mr. Perfect, get hitched and live happily ever after, despite obstacles that get in the way, like disapproving fathers and unreliable fianc√©s. The aim of course is always marriage, encouraged by the fear of spinsterdom. As wordsmith J. Jack Halberstam eloquently states "The wedding is the cum shot of the romantic comedy."  We see this idea reflected by the women around us that feel an urgency to marry and settle down before they're 'too old'. Many women fear that once they are past their 'sell-by date' they will no longer be useful, valuable or desirable, therefore they had better get married soon, or else. In China, for example, 'shengnu' is a derogatory word for unmarried women in their late twenties which translates to "leftover woman".

					<p class="paragraphleft"> A still life (plural: still lifes) is a work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which are either natural (food, flowers, dead animals, plants, rocks, shells, etc.) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, etc.). With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greco-Roman art, still-life painting emerged as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century, and has remained significant since then. A still-life form gives the artist more freedom in the arrangement of elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture. Still life, as a particular genre, began with Netherlandish painting of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the English term still life derives from the Dutch word stilleven. Early still-life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. </p>

					<p class="paragraphleft"> A pie is a baked dish which is usually made of a pastry dough casing that covers or completely contains a filling of various sweet or savoury ingredients. Pies are defined by their crusts. A filled pie (also single-crust or bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the filling is placed on top of the pastry but left open. A top-crust pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry or other covering before baking. A two-crust pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, but many things can be used, including baking powder biscuits, mashed potatoes, and crumbs. Pies can be a variety of sizes, ranging from bite-size to ones designed for multiple servings. The need for nutritious, easy-to-store, easy-to-carry, and long-lasting foods on long journeys, in particular at sea, was initially solved by taking live food along with a butcher or cook. However, this took up additional space on what were either horse-powered treks or small ships, reducing the time of travel before additional food was required. This resulted in early armies adopting the style of hunter-foraging.</p>

				Here's are some pretty pictures. Each one of them moves ever so slightly. Have a look. The candle all the way over on the right flickers slightly. Scroll up to the Snails on Still Life, and you'll see two of the snails on the left half of your screen squirming a little bit. My favourite one is of the oranges with the bugs crawling around. It's a little bit morbid, but it's still very pretty.</p>

                Learning coding empowers you to do many things you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be able to do. These things include hand-crafting your own websites, becoming a career coder or even starting a technology business. Most importantly, you‚Äôll be able to understand the technology shaping your world. You‚Äôve undoubtedly heard or read somewhere that everyone needs to learn coding, right? Well, people say that for a reason! Whether you‚Äôre looking for a career in the industry, starting a new hobby or just wanting to understand technology, you can benefit from learning coding. It‚Äôs incredible to think how much the world has changed since 1991, when the World Wide Web first started. The web has taken over our lives and it‚Äôs showing no sign of stopping. Who knows where the web will take us in the future? Perhaps in another 10 years every person will have their own website. If one thing‚Äôs certain, it‚Äôs that a website is a very valuable thing to have these days. If you own a business, a web presence is a must. If you don‚Äôt, you still might want a personal blog or portfolio site to sell your skills to prospective employers. Of course, your ability to create and maintain a website is severely limited unless you learn HTML and CSS code, the code that all websites run on.

                I really enjoyed learning how to code over the weekend. I feel very lucky to have been able to learn such a cool skill with two great and supportive tutors. It's going to be sad when I leave university, and won't be able to partake in cool short course for cheap!
